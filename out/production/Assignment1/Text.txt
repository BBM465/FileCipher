Ownership of bitcoin is established through digital keys, bitcoin addresses and digital signatures.
The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored
by end-users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. The digital keys in a user’s wallet
are completely independent of the bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user’s
wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the Internet. Keys enable many of
the interesting properties of bitcoin, including de- centralized trust and control, ownership
attestation and the cryptographic-proof security model.
